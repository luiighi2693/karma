    <h2>THE GRAND PRIZE IS MEETING YOUR SOULMATES</h2>
    <h2>THE CHALLANGE IS STAYING IN THE GAME</h2>
    <h2>THE ADVENTURE IS WHAT YOU DO ALONG THE WAY</h2>
    <br>
    <div id="rules_box">
      <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The first objective of the game is to narrow down the number of Potential Soulmates to as few as you can by being honest about what you are looking for.</p>
      <p>Dishonesty is optional.  The game is not programmed to validate your answers but to match your specified desires to the specified desires of like minded players and guide you to your soulmates.  The others players are your judge. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The second objective is to go on an outings with players and let the game and other players know what the outing was like.  You'll not only rate the date but the location, food, or fun event you went to, etc. these comment will go into a news feed and will help other players pick things to do as well as give an idea of how your date went.  And very importantly if you have found "the one."  People who announce that they have found the one will be entered into contests for prizes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The third and final objective is to stay in the game as long as possible so that you can actually find the people of your dreams.  These are not you friends and family and this game is not just a database of people's pictures.  It's a real adventure and opportunity to overcome the hurdles that keep us from finding the people that we might meet once or twice in a lifetime.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>RULES</h2>
      <br>
      <p>You will enter the Game through one of three doors.  Values, Compatibility, or Intimacy</p>
      <div class="3_doors">
        <p><img src="images/3_doors.png" width="480" height="129" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></p>
      </div>
      <div id="3_doors"> <br>
      </div>
      <p>The 3 Doors are always accessible through your Journey Book and you can answer as many or as little questions from each area that you'd like.  The less questions you answer the more avatars you'll see and be able to play with but you will also be the farthest from your primary objective.  This does have the benefit of allowing you to play and go on outing indefinitely. :)</p>
      <p>The door you first enter will get you closest to the people with the same Primary Preference.  If you enter through Values and only answer questions about your values then you will only see avatars who have enter through Values.  If someone is dishonest and lewd you have the ability to hide your avatar and profile from them or knock them off the game.</p>
      <p>Likewise if your Primary Preference is Intimacy you will immediately have access to avatars who consider their Intimate Preferences as important and Primary to their relationships.  The same holds true for people wanting to connect on a compatibility level.  For instance, "I am a Man looking for a Man for friendship for Bowling" or "I am a Man looking for a Group for Soccer" or "I am a Man looking for a Woman for Movies". </p>
      <br>
      <p>You will be given a Journey Book with three sections for your crteria which will also keep record of your game stats.  You can look at other people's Journey Books unless they lock them.  In addition to the Journey Book you will see avatars .  Remember you are not obligated to answer any questions in the Journey Book but you will not see those Avatars who have answered question or made their desires known.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Every Player creates or picks an Avatar to represent them.  You have to exchanges pictures if you decide to go on an outing together.  If you lie and the person realizes it they can "ZAP" you out of the game.</p>
